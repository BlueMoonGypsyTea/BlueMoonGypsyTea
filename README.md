- 👋 Greetings. Kitty here of @BlueMoonGypsyTea Room. 
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding and learning as much as I can. Started my journey in 1995, designed for about 5 years and life took off with other plans. 
- 🌱 I’m just starting out again, diving in hard (Italian, impatient) and getting pretty frustrated when things should work and aren't doing as they're told. 
- But I'm loving the learning process and watching in utter amazement all these vids of people just writing off the top of their heads. Wonderful!
- 💞️ I’m open to suggestions, gentle nudges and any help anyone wants to toss a great-grandmother of 5 on this journey.
- 📫 email @ rpfaerie@gmail.com works best. I'm not on everyday but will check in when I lift my head up from whatever I'm glued to.
